The UNSW Security Society presents the Autumn K17 CTF. There are challenges for
everyone, whether this is your first CTF or you are an experienced veteran.

There are a limited number of teams, which will be filled on a first come first
serve basis. All participating UNSW students must be a member of the UNSW
Security Society.

[Team Sheet](/k17autumn/teams/)

The CTF is being held in K17 at UNSW Kensington Campus and you must be
physically present to compete. We welcome everyone to come along and learn about
security, have some fun with the challenges and enjoy some free pizza!

Please try to arrange yourselves into teams through the registration form,
filling teams completely if possible. If you do not have a team on the day we
can assign you to one, and will match you with others of a similar skill level
as best we can. If you do not complete the registration form by Friday 12th May,
you will not be permitted to participate in the CTF.
