Hi everyone,

This weekend's CTF is 'XCTF', a competition hosted in China. It is jeopardy
style and we will be competing online over Slack. The event lasts for 48 hours,
but of course you can put in as little or as much as you like :)

Create an individual account and [join K17]({% link join.md %}) (there are unlimited numbers allowed
on teams for this event).
