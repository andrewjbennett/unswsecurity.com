Google CTF qualifiers are this weekend!
It's understandable that people are busy with exams but since this is a well known CTF we thought we'd sign up for it. As usual you can participate as little or as much as you like.
There is prize money associated with the finals and so it will be competitive, which means that the challenges will probably be non-trivial, but if you're keen definitely have a go anyway :)
