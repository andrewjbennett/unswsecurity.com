Hey everyone,

This weekend is PlaidCTF 2017. It's a very notable event and one of the
highlights of the CTF calendar for the year. It's run by a group out of Carnegie
Mellon University called the Plaid Parliament of Pwning, who are regarded as one
of the best CTF teams.

Starting from Saturday morning, it will run for 48 hours. As usual we'll compete
from our slack channel. Everyone is most definitely welcome (especially
beginners!) and you are free to participate as much as you like :)
