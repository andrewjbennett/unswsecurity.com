Spooky Scary Viruses: Reverse Engineering Malware 101

Welcome to the third Security Society Workshop of 2017!
In this workshop we will explore the mystical world of malware.
We'll be covering a brief overview of malware in its various incarnations over
time as well as the fundamentals of malware analysis. (Workflow, techniques,
etc).

Difficulty: Intermediate.

Some basic knowledge of OS and assembly recommended.

We have the lab booked from 1pm - 3pm. The main workshop content is slated to
run from 1pm-2pm, we'll have an hour left over for extra time hack / learn / ask
embarrassing questions.
