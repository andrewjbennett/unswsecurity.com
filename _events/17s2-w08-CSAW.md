CSAW is a big event on the yearly CTF calendar and it's on this weekend!
It's one of the biggest undergrad competitions internationally, and
we'll be meeting up over the duration in the K17 Security Lab.

CSAW is a jeopardy style CTF, and many teams across the world will be
playing. It's the qualification round, with top teams able to play at
one of the international onsite locations in the finals (Abu Dhabi for
the Asia region). In the past K17 have ranked in top places in CSAW, so
let's get together and hack some sh..stuff!
