Welcome back to another semester! Our weekly workshops are going to kick off with a nice and easy hangout session complemented by our latest addition, weekly lockpicking!

From 3pm onwards we can hang out and see some familiar faces, we can also discuss future workshops!

From 4pm - 5pm we will have a lockpicking session hosted by our reisdent expert Jeremy.
