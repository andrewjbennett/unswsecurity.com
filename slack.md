# <center>Join us on Slack!</center>
## To join the k17hackers slack:
<br>

Our slack team, **k17hackers**, can be found at [k17hackers.slack.com](https://k17hackers.slack.com).
<br><br>

You don't need an invitation: just sign up with your **@unsw.edu.au** email address.
<br><br>

*for example: **z1234567@unsw.edu.au** -- yes, zid**@unsw.edu.au**, not **@student.unsw.edu.au**, trust me, it works :)*
<br><br>
